# Simplihacks_Hackathon
Participated in a hackathon on June 19th, 2021 to June 20th, 2021. 

My team and I built a website that awards good study habits by converting time spent studying into monetary donations to charities such as UNICEF, Peace Corps, WWF, and more!

My part of the work was designing and building the landing pages, contact and donation forms, and account page. Very fun project, stayed up for 24 hours for this hackathon.

In the end, our hack won BEST EDUCATION HACK! Very happy and proud of the end result. Website can be accessed in https://indexhtml.retrohalo.repl.co/index.html
